<summary>Code sample</summary>

<!--

1.   Please create a minimal reproducible sample that shows the problem
     and attach it below between the lines with the backticks.

     Without this we will unlikely be able to progress on the issue, and because of that
     we regretfully will have to close it.

     If your problem goes out of what can be placed in file, for example
     you have a problem with native channels, you can upload the full code of
     your reproduction into a separate repository and link it.

2.   Switch flutter to master channel and run the app on a physical device
     using profile or release mode. Verify that the performance issue can be
     reproduced there.

     The bleeding edge master channel is encouraged here because Flutter is
     constantly fixing bugs and improving its performance. Your problem in an
     older Flutter version may have already been solved in the master channel.

     If there are any analysis errors, try resolving them before filing this issue.

<summary>flutter doctor -v</summary>

<!--
     Finally, to better illustrate the issue, consider attaching
     screenshots and/or videos.

     You can upload these directly on GitHub.
     Beware that video file size is limited to 10MB.
