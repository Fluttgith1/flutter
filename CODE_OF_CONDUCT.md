# Code of conduct

We expect Flutter's contributors to act professionally and respectfully, and
we expect our social spaces to be safe and dignified environments.

Specifically:

* Respect people, their identities, their culture, and their work.
* Be kind. Be courteous. Be welcoming.
* Listen. Consider and acknowledge people's points before responding.

As everyone always starts from somewhere, it is imperative that our community
remain an open and diverse group of developers of all varieties. Mistakes are
a part of life and will be made, that is how we as humans learn. Mistakes made
by less-experienced developers will not be met with negative comments or attitudes,
and if so, action will be taken against those who committing them. 

We strongly encourage developers of all skill ranges to spend time going 
through the variety of documentation available, and ask lots of questions.
Communication is key in many facets of life, learning programming included.
We want everyone to feel confident and comfortable to make mistakes and 
work towards becoming the best developer they can be. We're all here to help
each other.

Should you experience anything that makes you feel unwelcome in Flutter's
community, please contact [conduct@flutter.dev](mailto:conduct@flutter.dev)
or, if you prefer, directly contact someone on the team, for instance
[Hixie](mailto:ian@hixie.ch) or [Tim](mailto:timsneath@google.com). We will
not tolerate harassment from anyone in Flutter's community, even outside
of Flutter's public communication channels.

## Conflict resolution

When multiple contributors disagree on the direction for a particular
patch or the general direction of the project, the conflict should be
resolved by communication. The people who disagree should get
together, try to understand each other's points of view, and work to
find a design that addresses everyone's concerns.

This is usually sufficient to resolve issues. If you cannot come to an
agreement, ask for the advice of a more senior member of the team. To
avoid conflict or confusion, refrain from allowing the discussion to spill
over and confuse others in the process.

Be wary of agreement by attrition, where one person argues a point
repeatedly until other participants give up in the interests of moving
on. This is not conflict resolution, as it does not address everyone's
concerns. Be wary of agreement by compromise, where two good competing
solutions are merged into one mediocre solution. A conflict is
addressed when the participants agree that the final solution is
_better_ than all the conflicting proposals. Sometimes the solution is
more work than either of the proposals. [Embrace the yak

## Questions

It's always ok to ask questions. Ask lots of them! It is the best way
to gain a deeper understanding of this project and further your knowledge.
Our systems are large, and nobody will be an expert in all the systems.
Our goal is for everyone to feel comfortable to ask questions, and creating
a community of respectful and helpful developers will benefit everyone.
However, once you find the answer, document it in the first place you looked. 
That way, the next person will be brought up to speed even quicker.
Therefore, as we continue forward, newcomers and more expwerienced developers alike
will be able to have their answers answered in a much more simplified way.

If I make fun of people, I train them not to tell me when they have those moments. And I miss out on the fun." "Diet coke and mentos thing? What's that?" "Oh, man! We're going to the grocery store."
