  // TODO(ianh): Implement the following (see ../services/image_resolution.dart):
  //
  // * If [width] and [height] are both specified, and [scale] is not, then
  //   size-aware asset resolution will be attempted also, with the given
  //   dimensions interpreted as logical pixels.
  //
  // * If the images have platform, locale, or directionality variants, the
  //   current platform, locale, and directionality are taken into account
  //   during asset resolution as well.
  /// Creates a widget that displays an [ImageStream] obtained from an asset
  /// bundle. The key for the image is given by the `name` argument.
  ///
  /// The `package` argument must be non-null when displaying an image from a
  /// package and null otherwise. See the `Assets in packages` section for
  /// details.
  ///
  /// If the `bundle` argument is omitted or null, then the
  /// [DefaultAssetBundle] will be used.
  ///
  /// By default, the pixel-density-aware asset resolution will be attempted. In
  /// addition:
  ///
  /// * If the `scale` argument is provided and is not null, then the exact
  /// asset specified will be used. To display an image variant with a specific
  /// density, the exact path must be provided (e.g. `images/2x/cat.png`).
  ///
  /// If [excludeFromSemantics] is true, then [semanticLabel] will be ignored.
  ///
  /// The [name] and [repeat] arguments must not be null.
  ///
  /// Either the [width] and [height] arguments should be specified, or the
  /// widget should be placed in a context that sets tight layout constraints.
  /// Otherwise, the image dimensions will change as the image is loaded, which
  /// will result in ugly layout changes.
  ///
  /// Use [filterQuality] to change the quality when scaling an image.
  /// Use the [FilterQuality.low] quality setting to scale the image,
  /// which corresponds to bilinear interpolation, rather than the default
  /// [FilterQuality.none] which corresponds to nearest-neighbor.
  ///
  /// {@tool sample}
  ///
  /// Suppose that the project's `pubspec.yaml` file contains the following:
  ///
  /// ```yaml
  /// flutter:
  ///   assets:
  ///     - images/cat.png
  ///     - images/2x/cat.png
  ///     - images/3.5x/cat.png
  /// ```
  /// {@end-tool}
  ///
  /// On a screen with a device pixel ratio of 2.0, the following widget would
  /// render the `images/2x/cat.png` file:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// Image.asset('images/cat.png')
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This corresponds to the file that is in the project's `images/2x/`
  /// directory with the name `cat.png` (the paths are relative to the
  /// `pubspec.yaml` file).
  ///
  /// On a device with a 4.0 device pixel ratio, the `images/3.5x/cat.png` asset
  /// would be used. On a device with a 1.0 device pixel ratio, the
  /// `images/cat.png` resource would be used.
  ///
  /// The `images/cat.png` image can be omitted from disk (though it must still
  /// be present in the manifest). If it is omitted, then on a device with a 1.0
  /// device pixel ratio, the `images/2x/cat.png` image would be used instead.
  ///
  ///
  /// ## Assets in packages
  ///
  /// To create the widget with an asset from a package, the [package] argument
  /// must be provided. For instance, suppose a package called `my_icons` has
  /// `icons/heart.png` .
  ///
  /// {@tool sample}
  /// Then to display the image, use:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// Image.asset('icons/heart.png', package: 'my_icons')
  /// ```
  /// {@end-tool}
  ///
  /// Assets used by the package itself should also be displayed using the
  /// [package] argument as above.
  ///
  /// If the desired asset is specified in the `pubspec.yaml` of the package, it
  /// is bundled automatically with the app. In particular, assets used by the
  /// package itself must be specified in its `pubspec.yaml`.
  ///
  /// A package can also choose to have assets in its 'lib/' folder that are not
  /// specified in its `pubspec.yaml`. In this case for those images to be
  /// bundled, the app has to specify which ones to include. For instance a
  /// package named `fancy_backgrounds` could have:
  ///
  /// ```
  /// lib/backgrounds/background1.png
  /// lib/backgrounds/background2.png
  /// lib/backgrounds/background3.png
  /// ```
  ///
  /// To include, say the first image, the `pubspec.yaml` of the app should
  /// specify it in the assets section:
  ///
  /// ```yaml
  ///   assets:
  ///     - packages/fancy_backgrounds/backgrounds/background1.png
  /// ```
  ///
  /// The `lib/` is implied, so it should not be included in the asset path.
  ///
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///
  ///  * [AssetImage], which is used to implement the behavior when the scale is
  ///    omitted.
  ///  * [ExactAssetImage], which is used to implement the behavior when the
  ///    scale is present.
