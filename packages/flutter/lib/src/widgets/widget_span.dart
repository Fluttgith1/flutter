/// The [widget] property is the widget that will be embedded. It is the
/// widget's responsibility to size itself appropriately, the text will
/// not enforce any constraints.
///
/// A [TextSpan] object can be styled using its [style] property.
/// The style will be applied to the [text] and the [children].
///
/// A [TextSpan] object can just have plain text, or it can have
/// children [TextSpan] objects with their own styles that (possibly
/// only partially) override the [style] of this object. If a
/// [TextSpan] has both [text] and [children], then the [text] is
/// treated as if it was an unstyled [TextSpan] at the start of the
/// [children] list.
///
/// To paint a [TextSpan] on a [Canvas], use a [TextPainter]. To display a text
/// span in a widget, use a [RichText]. For text with a single style, consider
/// using the [Text] widget.
///
