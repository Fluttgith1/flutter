/// Builder callback for [TweenAnimationBuilder].
///
/// The callback is expected to return a [Widget] built with the current
/// `value` of the animation. The `child` is passed-though from the
/// [TweenAnimationBuilder] as-is and should be incorporated into the widget
/// subtree if it is non-null.
typedef TweenAnimationBuilderCallback<T> = Widget Function(BuildContext context, T value, Widget child);

/// [Widget] builder that animates a property of a [Widget] to a target value
/// whenever the target value changes.
///
/// The type of the animated property ([Color], [Rect], [double], etc.) is
/// defined via the type of the provided [tween] (e.g. [ColorTween],
/// [RectTween], [Tween<double>], etc.).
///
/// The [tween] also defines the target value for the animation: When the widget
/// first builds, it animates from [Tween.begin] to [Tween.end]. A new animation
/// can be triggered anytime by providing a new [tween] with a new [Tween.end]
/// value. The new animation runs from the current animation value (which may be
/// [Tween.end] of the old [tween], if that animation completed) to [Tween.end]
/// of the new [tween].
///
/// The animation is further customized by providing a [curve] and [duration].
///
/// The current value of the animation along with the [child] is passed to
/// the [builder] callback, which is expected to build a [Widget] based on the
/// current animation value. The [builder] is called throughout the animation
/// for every animation value until [Tween.end] is reached.
///
/// The [animationStatusListener] is informed of the current status of the
/// animation. Registering an [animationStatusListener] may be useful to trigger
/// an action (like another animation) at the end of the current animation.
///
/// {@tool snippet --template=stateful_widget_scaffold}
/// This example shows an [IconButton] that "zooms" in when the widget first
/// builds (its size smoothly increases from 0 to 24) and whenever the button
/// is pressed, it smoothly changes its size to the new target value of either
/// 48 or 24.
///
/// ```dart
/// double targetValue = 24.0;
///
/// @override
/// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///   return Center(
///     child: TweenAnimationBuilder(
///       tween: Tween<double>(begin: 0, end: targetValue),
///       duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
///       builder: (BuildContext context, double size, Widget child) {
///         return IconButton(
///           iconSize: size,
///           color: Colors.blue,
///           icon: child,
///           onPressed: () {
///             setState(() {
///               targetValue = targetValue == 24.0 ? 48.0 : 24.0;
///             });

  ///
  /// If the pre-built subtree is passed as the child parameter, the
  /// [TweenAnimationBuilder] will pass it back to the [builder] function so
  /// that it can be incorporated into the build.
