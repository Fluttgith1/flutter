/// A widget that displays 2 children side-by-side or one below the other, while
/// also avoiding any hinge or fold that the screen might contain.
///
///  * By "hinge" we mean any [DisplayFeature] reported by [MediaQueryData.displayFeatures]
///  that completely splits the screen area in 2 parts. For phones with a
///  continuous screen that folds, the "fold" area is 0-width and does not visualy
///  create 2 separate screens.
///  * On screens with a hinge, the 2 panes are positioned on each side of the
///  hinge. In this case, both [paneProportion] and [direction] are ignored.
///  * On screens without a hinge, [paneProportion] is used for deciding how
///  much space each pane uses and [direction] is used for deciding if the 2
///  panes are laid out horizontally or vertically.
///
/// This widget is similar to [Flex], in that it also takes [textDirection] and
/// [verticalDirection] parameters, which are used for deciding in what order the
/// panes are laid out (e.g left to right would position pane 1 on the left and
/// pane 2 on the right).
///
/// For narrow screens where you want to display only one pane, you can use [panePriority]
/// to pick either [TwoPanePriority.pane1] or [TwoPanePriority.pane2].
///
/// In addition, this widget also wraps children in [MediaQuery] parents that
/// makes sense for their side of the screen. For example, let's consider a flip
/// phone with a notch at the top of the screen. The hinge is horizontal, so the
/// 2 halves of the screen are one at the top and one at the bottom. In this case
/// the top pane will have top padding in order to avoid the notch, but the bottom
/// pane does not have top padding, since it does not have the notch.
///
/// See also
///
///  * [DisplayFeature] and [MediaQueryData.displayFeatures], to further
///  understand display features, such as hinge areas
