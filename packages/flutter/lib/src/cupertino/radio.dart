/// A Material Design radio button.
///
/// Used to select between a number of mutually exclusive values. When one radio
/// button in a group is selected, the other radio buttons in the group cease to
/// be selected. The values are of type `T`, the type parameter of the [Radio]
/// class. Enums are commonly used for this purpose.
///
/// The radio button itself does not maintain any state. Instead, selecting the
/// radio invokes the [onChanged] callback, passing [value] as a parameter. If
/// [groupValue] and [value] match, this radio will be selected. Most widgets
/// will respond to [onChanged] by calling [State.setState] to update the
/// radio button's [groupValue].
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// Here is an example of Radio widgets wrapped in ListTiles, which is similar
/// to what you could get with the RadioListTile widget.
///
/// The currently selected character is passed into `groupValue`, which is
/// maintained by the example's `State`. In this case, the first [Radio]
/// will start off selected because `_character` is initialized to
/// `SingingCharacter.lafayette`.
///
/// If the second radio button is pressed, the example's state is updated
/// with `setState`, updating `_character` to `SingingCharacter.jefferson`.
/// This causes the buttons to rebuild with the updated `groupValue`, and
/// therefore the selection of the second button.
///
/// Requires one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/radio/radio.0.dart **

///  * [RadioListTile], which combines this widget with a [ListTile] so that
///    you can give the radio button a label.
