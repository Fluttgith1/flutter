/// [StrutStyle] defines the properties of the strut to use on the entire paragraph.
///
/// To define a strut, a non-negative value must be defined for [fontSize] and at
/// least one of [lineHeight] and [leading]. Failure to define the minimum properties
/// will result in a zero strut and it will have no effect on the layout. Negative and
/// null values are treated the same. Most use cases will prefer [fontSize] and
/// [lineHeight] to be defined.
///
/// Strut is a feature that allows minimum line heights to be set. The effect is as
/// if a zero width space is laid out at the beginning of each line in the
/// paragraph. This imaginary space has the dimensions if it were laid out according
/// to the properties defined in this class.
///
/// No lines will be shorter than the strut. The ascent and descent strut
/// metrics are calculated, and any font that has a shorter ascent or descent will
/// take the ascent and descent of the strut. Larger ascent or decents will lay out
/// as normal.
///
/// The vertical components of strut are as follows:
/// 
///  * `leading * fontSize / 2` or half the font leading if `leading` is undefined (half leading)
///  * `ascent * lineHeight`
///  * `descent * lineHeight`
///  * `leading * fontSize / 2` or half the font leading if `leading` is undefined (half leading)
/// 
/// The values for `ascent` and `descent` are provided by the [fontFamily]. If no
/// [fontFamily] is provided, then the platform's default family will be used.
///
/// Each line's spacing above the baseline will be at least as tall as the half
/// leading plus ascent. Each line's spacing below the baseline will be at least as
/// tall as the half leading plus descent.
/// 
/// ### Fields
/// 
///  * [fontFamily] the name of the font to use when calcualting the strut (e.g., Roboto).
///    No glyphs from the font will be drawn and the font will be used purely for metrics.
/// 
///  * [fontSize] the size of the ascent plus descent in logical pixels. This is also
///    used as the basis of the custom leading caluclation. This must be a positive number
///    for strut to work.
///
///  * [lineHeight] the height of the line as a ratio of [fontSize]. This property does
///    not affect the leading height, which is controlled separately through [leading].
///    When negative or null and a custom leading is defined, then a lineHeight of zero
///    will be used.
/// 
///  * [leading] the custom leading to apply to the strut as a ratio of [fontSize].
///    Leading is additional spacing between lines. Half of the leading is added
///    to the top and the other half to the bottom of the line height. When negative
///    or null and a [lineHeight] is defined, the font's default leading will be used.
///
///  * [fontWeight] the typeface thickness to use when calculating the strut (e.g., bold).
/// 
///  * [fontStyle] the typeface variant to use when calculating the strut (e.g., italics).
/// 
///  * [forceStrutHeight] when true, all lines will be laid out with the height of the
///    strut. All line and run-specific metrics will be ignored/overrided and only strut
///    metrics will be used instead. This property guarantees uniform line spacing, however
///    text overlap will become possible. This property should be enabled with caution as
///    it bypasses a large portion of the vertical layout system.
/// 
/// ### Examples
/// 
/// {@tool sample}
/// Here, the text will be rendered at font size 10, however, the vertical line
/// height will be the strut height (Roboto in font size 30 * 1.5) as the text itself is
/// smaller than the strut.
/// 
/// ```dart
/// Text(
///   "Hello, world!\nSecond line!",
///   strutStyle: StrutStyle(
///     fontFamily: "Roboto",
///     fontSize: 30,
///     lineHeight: 1.5,
///   ),
///   style: TextStyle(
///     fontSize: 10,
///     fontFamily: "Raleway"
///   ),
/// ),
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
/// 
/// {@tool sample}
/// Here, strut is used to absorb the additional line height in the second line.
/// The strut [lineHeight] was defined as 1.2, which caused all lines to be laid out
/// taller than without strut. This extra space was able to accomodate the larger
/// font size `Second line!` without causing the line height to change for the second
/// line only.
/// 
/// ```dart
/// Text.rich(
///   TextSpan(
///     text: "First line!\n",
///     style: TextStyle(
///       fontSize: 14,
///       fontFamily: "Roboto"
///     ),
///     children: <TextSpan>[
///       TextSpan(
///         text: "Second line!\n",
///         style: TextStyle(
///           fontSize: 16,
///           fontFamily: "Roboto"
///         ),
///       ),
///       TextSpan(
///         text: "Third line!\n",
///         style: TextStyle(
///           fontSize: 14,
///           fontFamily: "Roboto"
///         ),
///       ),
///     ],
///   ),
///   strutStyle: StrutStyle(
///     fontFamily: "Roboto",
///     fontSize: 14,
///     lineHeight: 1.2,
///   ),
/// ),
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
/// 
/// {@tool sample}
/// Here, strut is used to enable strange and overlapping text to achieve unique
/// effects. The `M`s in lines 2 and 3 are able to extend above their lines and
/// fill empty space in lines above. The [forceStrutHeight] is enabled and functions
/// as a 'grid' for the glyphs to draw on.
