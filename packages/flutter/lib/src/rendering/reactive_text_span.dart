/// An immutable span of text that can react to gestures and mouse movements.
///
/// Aside from what [TextSpan] provides, [ReactiveTextSpan] also accepts a
/// [recognizer] that recognizes gestures starting on this text span, as well as
/// allowing customizing the [mouseCursor] when a mouse hovers over it.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// This example shows how to use [ReactiveTextSpan] with a gesture recognizer.
/// It defines a `BuzzingText` widget which uses the [HapticFeedback]
/// class to vibrate the device when the user long-presses the "find the" span,
/// which is underlined in wavy green. The hit-testing is handled by the
/// [RichText] widget.
///
/// ```dart
/// class BuzzingText extends StatefulWidget {
///   @override
///   _BuzzingTextState createState() => _BuzzingTextState();
/// }
