About Flutter
We think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive, extensible and open development model.

Beautiful user experiences
We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework. Flutter's layered architecture gives you control over every pixel on the screen, and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate graphics, video, text and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full set of widgets that deliver pixel-perfect experiences on both iOS and Android.

Fast results
Flutter is fast. It's powered by the same hardware-accelerated Skia 2D graphics library that underpins Chrome and Android. We architected Flutter to support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device. Flutter code is powered by the world-class Dart platform, which enables compilation to 32-bit and 64-bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android, as well as JavaScript for the web and Intel x64 for desktop devices.

Productive development
Flutter offers stateful hot reload, allowing you to make changes to your code and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.

Extensible and open model
Flutter works with any development tool (or none at all), but includes editor plug-ins for both Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ / Android Studio. Flutter provides thousands of packages to speed your development, regardless of your target platform. And accessing other native code is easy, with support for both FFI and platform-specific APIs.

Flutter is a fully open source project, and we welcome contributions. Information on how to get started can be found at our contributor guide.
