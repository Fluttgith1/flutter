# Splash Demo: Kitchen Sink

This project is an example of a splash screen that shows a logo for a launch screen and then
zooms that logo towards the screen while fading content beneath it, masked by the logo.

The purpose of this example project is to push the limits of what Flutter's splash system affords.
