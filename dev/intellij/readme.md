## Using IntelliJ

- Download an IntelliJ based product (like IntelliJ Community Edition):
  [www.jetbrains.com/idea/download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- Install the Dart plugin (Preferences... > Plugins > Browse Repositories...)
- TBD: _Install the Flutter plugin_
- From IntelliJ, choose File > Open..., and navigate to and open
  `<path-to-flutter>/dev/intellij/`

You should see the `Flutter` project open, with a 1/2 dozen Dart and Flutter
modules. There are some pre-populated launch configurations, including one
for the `flutter_tools` package and a few for the Flutter packages in
`//examples/`.
